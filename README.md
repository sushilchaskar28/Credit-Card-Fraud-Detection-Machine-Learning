# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Machine-Learning

Implemented 5 algorithms to build a classification model to predict credit card fraudand python files are included in the folder along with dataset file, creditcard.csv (can be retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).


Models are:

1. Naive Bayes (naive_bayes.py)
2. Logistic Regression (log_reg.py)
3. Support Vector Machine (svm.py)
4. Random Forest Classifier (random_forest.py)
5. Gradient Boosting Classifier (xgboost.py)

Dataset file should be placed in the same folder as code files. 

Also included a log file (RUN_LOG.txt) containing results of a single run of all classification models.
